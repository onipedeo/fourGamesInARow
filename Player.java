/**
 * The player class is concerned with describing a player and things that relate
 * to it. It keeps track of the name of a player, the order of the player in
 * relation to other players in the game, and the move the player may want to
 * make (which is just as simple as the user picking which column of the board
 * they want their token to be dropped in). This class could also have logic to
 * create only valid users. E.g. the playerNumber should not be greater than 4
 * based on the specification we've received.
